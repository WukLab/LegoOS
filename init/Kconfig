config ARCH
	string
	option env="ARCH"

config KERNELVERSION
	string

config CROSS_COMPILE
	string "Cross-compiler tool prefix"
	help
	  Same as running 'make CROSS_COMPILE=prefix-' but stored for
	  default make runs in this kernel build directory.  You don't
	  need to set this unless you want the configured kernel build
	  directory to select the cross-compiler automatically.

config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version - append to kernel release"
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of your kernel version.
	  This will show up when you type uname, for example.
	  The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
	  any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
	  object and source tree, in that order.  Your total string can
	  be a maximum of 64 characters.

config LOCALVERSION_AUTO
	bool "Automatically append version information to the version string"
	default n
	help
	  This will try to automatically determine if the current tree is a
	  release tree by looking for git tags that belong to the current
	  top of tree revision.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a git-based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.

	  (The actual string used here is the first eight characters produced
	  by running the command:

	    $ git rev-parse --verify HEAD

	  which is done within the script "scripts/setlocalversion".)
